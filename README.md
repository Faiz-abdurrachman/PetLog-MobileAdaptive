# 🐾 PetLog – Blockchain Pet Identity Platform
> **"Every pet deserves a verified story."**

PetLog is a **Web3-based decentralized biodata system for pets**, built to store and verify **lineage, vaccination, and health records** on-chain.  
By connecting breeders, veterinarians, and owners through **validator-based smart contracts**, PetLog eliminates fake certificates and fragmented data — creating **trust, transparency, and traceability** across the global pet ecosystem.


PetLog revolutionizes pet ownership verification by creating immutable, blockchain-based digital identities for pets. Built on Cardano Pre-Production testnet, each pet receives a unique NFT passport containing verified lineage, health records, and ownership history.

> **Hackathon Project**: Building trust in pet ownership through decentralized digital passports on Cardano

## 🎯 Problem Statement

- **42% of pedigree certificates in Asia are unverifiable** (Asian Kennel Network, 2024)
- **73% of veterinary clinics in Indonesia use manual records** (Indonesian Veterinary Association, 2023)
- **No standardized system** for pet data verification across developing markets

## 💡 Solution: Decentralized Trust Layer

PetLog creates a **blockchain-based trust network** where:
- 🧬 **Immutable Lineage Records** from certified breeders
- 💉 **Verified Health Logs** digitally signed by veterinarians  
- 🪪 **NFT Pet Passports** that travel with ownership transfers
- 🔗 **Validator Network** of trusted pedigree associations and clinics

## ✨ Key Features

- **🔐 Wallet Integration**: Seamless connection with Cardano wallets (Nami, Eternl, Gero, Flint)
- **🎨 Guided Minting Flow**: Intuitive pet passport creation with IPFS asset storage
- **📱 Personal Gallery**: View all owned pet passports with metadata resolution via Blockfrost
- **🔍 Passport Details**: Complete pet profiles with explorer links and provenance tracking
- **⚡ CIP-25 Compliant**: Following Cardano NFT metadata standards
- **🌐 IPFS Integration**: Decentralized storage via Pinata for pet photos and documents
